So sorry - I almost missed your message - for some reason it went directly to my spam folder and by pure chance I checked the spam folder today and saw it!! So sorry - I don\u2019t know why that happened - maybe the huji filter is not used to Chinese characters in the email and correlates them with some past fishing event. We are all well, thanks for asking. And you? Now, after the 3rd vaccination, life is almost back to normal in Israel. I\u2019m definitely planning to come to Ned\u2019s birthday.
